I’ve deployed zen following https://github.ibm.com/PrivateCloud/zen-operator/wiki/Bedrock---local-zen-operator-build-install-procedure-(via-OLM-ODLM) with ibm-zen-operator-catalog:1.1.0-amd64-253 and I’ve set iamIntegration: false. I can’t login with admin/password. Is there a way I can debug what’s going on?

The password gets randomly generated by default 
oc extract secret/admin-user-details --keys=initial_admin_password --to=-

Is there a way to install zen without bedrock?

You can bypass the issue by doing the install via OLM/ODLM, which does not involve with case packages

using a private registry for CP4D 4.0
